                    People think of him like some cold-blooded monster, but he's more human than anyone I know; he's so fragile inside. If
                    you pumped him full of love and betrayal and such, I think he'd fall apart. I think that's why he decided to love
                    humanity by letting everything wash over him. Do you see what I'm saying? He accepts everything, but he doesn't take it
                    in. He lets it wash over him.
